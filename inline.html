<h1 class="italic title">Jennifer Two</h1>
<p>
For twenty years I had no one to talk to except the computer, and the robots, and myself. The computer had no personality, the robots were <span class="bold">mindless</span> little drones, and I wasn't much of a conversationalist.</p>
<p>
Then <span class="italic">she showed up.</span></p>
<p>
I must have been asleep when it happened -- <span class="bold">the sky never got lighter or darker here,</span> just the same starlit twilight, so I'd taken to going to bed and waking up when I felt like it.</p>
<p>
I didn't feel like waking up only <span class="italic">four hours</span> after telling the computer to darken the windows and dim the lights. I needed a good <span class="italic" "bold">nine hours</span> of sleep to be functional these days. But I felt her, and she <span class="bold">jolted</span> me out of a dream that melted away instantly.</p>
<p>
"Computer, interrogative: <span class="italic">who's there?</span>"</p>
<p>
The androgynous voice, which had resisted two decades of me trying to reprogram it into something a little more pleasant, said, <span class="italic bold">"there is another human present on the island."</span></p>
